    <h4>Preparation time: 10 minutes</h4>
    <h4>Cooking time: 15 minutes</h4>
    <h4>Yield: 4 servings</h4>
    <h2>Ingredints:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (450 grams) cheese tortellini</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>   
        <li>Cook the cheese tortellini according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>

        <li>In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut√© for about 1 minute until fragrant.</li>

        <li>Sprinkle the flour over the melted butter and garlic. Stir constantly for 1-2 minutes to cook the flour and form a roux.</li>

        <li>Gradually whisk in the milk, ensuring there are no lumps. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce thickens and comes to a simmer.</li>

        <li>Reduce the heat to low. Stir in the shredded mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese, allowing them to melt into the sauce.</li>

        <li>Add the dried basil and dried oregano to the sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.</li>

        <li>Add the cooked cheese tortellini to the saucepan, gently tossing to coat the pasta evenly with the cheese sauce.</li>

        <li>Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the tortellini to absorb some of the sauce and become heated through.</li>

        <li>Remove from heat and let the flavors meld for a minute or two.</li>

        <li>Serve the Cheesy Tortellini Delight in bowls, garnished with fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>

        <li>Enjoy this irresistible dish as a comforting main course. You can serve it with a side of garlic bread and a green salad to complete the meal.</li>
