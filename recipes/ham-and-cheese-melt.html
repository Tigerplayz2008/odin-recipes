    <h4>Preparation time: 10 minutes</h4>
    <h4>Cooking time: 10 minutes</h4>
    <h4>Yield: 2 servings</h4>
    <h2>Ingredints:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices of bread (your choice of bread, such as white, whole wheat, or sourdough)</li>
        <li>8 ounces (225 grams) thinly sliced ham</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheese (a combination of cheddar and Swiss works well)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened</li>
        <li>Optional toppings: sliced tomatoes, onions, or pickles</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a pan or griddle over medium heat.</li>

        <li>Lay out the slices of bread on a clean work surface. Spread mayonnaise evenly on one side of each slice.</li>
        
        <li>Divide the ham into 2 equal portions. Place one portion of ham on the mayonnaise side of 2 bread slices.</li>
        
        <li>Sprinkle half of the shredded cheese evenly over the ham on each slice.</li>
        
        <li>If desired, add any additional toppings, such as sliced tomatoes, onions, or pickles.</li>
        
        <li>Place the remaining bread slices, mayonnaise side down, on top of the ham and cheese to form sandwiches.</li>
        
        <li>Spread the softened butter on the outsides of the sandwiches.</li>
        
        <li>Place the sandwiches in the preheated pan or griddle. Cook for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until the bread turns golden brown and crispy, and the cheese starts to melt.</li>
        
        <li>Carefully flip the sandwiches using a spatula and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes until the cheese is fully melted and the bread is toasted to your liking.</li>
        
        <li>Remove the sandwiches from the heat and let them cool for a minute or two. Cut each sandwich in half diagonally, if desired, and serve hot.</li>

        <li>Enjoy your mouthwatering Ham and Cheese Melt with your favorite side dish, such as potato chips, fries, or a fresh green salad.</li>
