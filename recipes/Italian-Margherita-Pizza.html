    <h4>Preparation time: 2 hours (including dough rising time)</h4>
    <h4>Cooking time: 15-20 minutes</h4>
    <h4>Yield: 2-4 servings</h4>
    <h2>Ingredints, Pizza Dough:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups (280 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup warm water (around 110째F/43째C)
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li> </ul>
    <h2>Ingredints, Toppings:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce or marinara sauce</li>
        <li>8 ounces (225 grams) fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced or torn into pieces</li>
        <li>2-3 ripe tomatoes, sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves, torn</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li> </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and active dry yeast. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture becomes frothy.</li>

            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>

            <li>Stir the ingredients together until a shaggy dough forms. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>

            <li>Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a greased bowl. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.</li>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 475째F (245째C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>

            <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. Transfer it to a floured surface and divide it into two equal portions. Cover the portions with a clean kitchen towel and let them rest for about 10 minutes.</li>

            <li>Roll out each portion of the dough into a thin circle or rectangle, depending on your preference. If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the rolled-out dough onto a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>

            <li>Spread half of the pizza sauce or marinara sauce evenly over each pizza crust, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>

            <li>Arrange the fresh mozzarella cheese slices or torn pieces evenly on top of the sauce. Add the sliced tomatoes, distributing them evenly.</li>

            <li>Season the pizzas with salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle torn basil leaves over the top.</li>

            <li>If using a pizza stone, carefully slide the pizzas onto the preheated stone in the oven. If using a baking sheet, place the sheet in the oven.</li>

            <li>Bake the pizzas for 15-20 minutes, or until the crust turns golden brown and crispy, and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>

            <li>Remove the pizzas from the oven and let them cool for a minute. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil.</li>

            <li>Slice the Classic Italian Margherita Pizzas into wedges or squares and serve hot. Enjoy the vibrant flavors of this traditional Italian delight.</li>
